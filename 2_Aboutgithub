## GITHUB

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git, a distributed version control system, at its core. The GitHub platform simplifies the process of collaborating on projects and provides a website, command-line tools, and overall flow that allows developers and users to work together.

As we learned earlier, GitHub provides an AI powered developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software. Let’s break down each one of the core pillars of the GitHub Enterprise platform, AI, Collaboration, Productivity, Security, and Scale.

### AI
Generative AI is dramatically transforming software development as we speak. The GitHub Enterprise platform is enhancing collaboration through AI-powered pull requests and issues, productivity through Copilot, and security by automating security checks faster.

### Collaboration
Collaboration is at the core of everything GitHub does. We know inefficient collaboration results in wasted time and money. We counteract that with a suite of seamless tools that allow collaboration to happen effortlessly.

Repositories, Issues, Pull Requests, and other tools help to enable developers, project managers, operation leaders, and others at the same company. It enables them to work faster together, cut down approval times, and ship more quickly.

### Productivity
Productivity is accelerated with automation that the GitHub Enterprise Platform provides. With built-in CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) tools directly integrated into the workflow, the platform gives users the ability to set tasks and forget them, taking care of routine administration and speeding up day-to-day work. This gives your developers more time to focus on what matters most, creating innovative solutions.

### Security
GitHub focuses on integrating security directly into the development process from the start. GitHub Enterprise platform includes native, first-party security features that minimize security risk with a built-in security solution. Plus, your code remains private within your organization. At the same time, you're able to take advantage of security overview and Dependabot.

GitHub has continued to make investments to ensure that our features are enterprise-ready. Microsoft and highly regulated industries trust GitHub, and we meet global compliance requirements.

### Scale
GitHub is the largest developer community of its kind with real-time data on over 100M+ developers, 330M+ repositories, and countless deployments. We’ve been able to understand the shifting needs of developers and make changes to our product to match.

This has translated into an incredible scale that is unmatched and unparalleled by any other company on the planet. Everyday we're gaining more insights from this impressive community and evolving the platform to meet their needs.

In essence, the GitHub Enterprise Platform focuses on the developer experience. It has the scale to provide industry-changing insights, collaboration capabilities for transformative efficiency, the tools for increased productivity, security at every step, and AI to power it all to new heights in a single, integrated platform.

Now let’s get into the backbone of GitHub, repositories.

## Introduction to repositories
Let’s first review:

What is a repository?
How to create a repository
Adding files to a repository
How to search for repositories
Introduction to gists, wikis, and GitHub pages

### What is a repository?
A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. It's one of the essential parts that helps you collaborate with people. You can use repositories to manage your work, track changes, store revision history, and work with others. Before we dive too deep, let’s first start with how to create a repository.

### What are gists
Now that we have a good understanding of repositories, we can review gists. Similarly to repositories, gists are a simplified way to share code snippets with others.

Every gist is a Git repository, which you can fork and clone and be made either public or secret. Public gists are displayed publicly where people can browse new ones as they’re created. Public gists are also searchable. Conversely, secret gists aren't searchable, but they aren’t entirely private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it.

To learn more about gists, see the linked article in our Resources section at the end of this module titled Creating Gists.

### What are wikis?
Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. While a README file quickly tells what your project can do, you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation.
